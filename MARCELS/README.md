This is a Python translation to the R code Jeremy Siegel provided on his MARCELS article on pitcherlist.com 

https://www.pitcherlist.com/pitcher-list-data-camp-intro-to-player-projections-with-r/ 


All credit and ideas come from Jeremy's work as well as Tom Tango's work which he referenced. This is meant to show that Python is able to be used in baseball analytics just like R, and should be used a learning resource for people with Python. This was also used as pratice for myself. Once again, Jeremy provided a great article and I just wanted to translate his R code to Python.
